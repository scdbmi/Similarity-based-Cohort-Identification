The goal of this study is to help clinical researchers expedite the process of cohort identification for clinical studies using an automatic similarity based approach to cohort identification. This algorithm is implemented using the Observational Medical Outcomes Practice (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) version 5.0 and is developed using MATLAB. This method uses a set of user-defined seed patients (or cases) who have already been identified for the cohort identification task to find similar patients that are in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). The current version of this algorithm extracts structured EHR data types (i.e. conditions, demographics, laboratory results, drugs, and procedures) for the user specified seed patients and a set of user specified unknown test patients in the EHR. The SQL script to randomly generate this list of test patients in the EHR has also been provided. Following this, the extracted data is processed, and a "target patient" representation is developed for the cohort identification task. This represents the ideal patient for the cohort identification task, and is used to find other similar patients from the test patient set. The algorithm is evaluated using the Precision at 5, Precision at 10, Precision at 20, Precision at 30, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rate (MRR), and the optimal Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics.
